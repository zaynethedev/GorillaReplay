# GorillaReplay

GorillaReplay is a Gorilla Tag BepInEx mod that allows the player to start a recording using the Z key on their keyboard, and stop one by using the X key. If the mod lags out your game during recording, go into the mod's configuration files and edit the resolution. *NOTE: This mod is currently incompatible with Yizzi's Camera Mod as the third person camera is copied over to the camera mod, so when recording in third person (set in configuration) it will not be able to find the third person camera. And this mod requires ffmpeg, which is why it is packed into a zip format. Feel free to add your own ffmpeg in the ffmpeg folder of the mod.*
